The `Nutanix` multi-component plugin can be used with HashiCorp [Packer](https://www.packer.io) to create custom images.

### Installation

To install this plugin, copy and paste this code into your Packer configuration, then run [`packer init`](https://www.packer.io/docs/commands/init).

```
packer {
  required_plugins {
    nutanix = {
      version = ">= 0.13.1"
      source  = "github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/nutanix"
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `packer plugins install` to manage installation of this plugin.

```sh
$ packer plugins install github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/nutanix
```

### Components

#### Builders

- [nutanix](/packer/integrations/nutanix-cloud-native/nutanix/latest/components/builder/nutanix) - The Nutanix builder will create a temporary VM as foundation of your Packer image, apply all providers you define to customize your image, then clone the VM disk image as your final Packer image.

### Limitations
#### Building temporary ISOs on MacOS
If you want to use the `cd_files` option to create an additional ISO image for kickstart files or similar purposes, be aware that macOS does not generate a compatible file by default.  
To enable support on macOS, please install xorriso.
```
 brew install xorriso
```
