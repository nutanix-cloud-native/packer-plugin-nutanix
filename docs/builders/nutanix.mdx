# Nutanix Builder

This document is going to detail all Nutanix plugin parameters.

## Principle
The Nutanix plugin will create a temporary VM as foundation of your Packer image, apply all providers you define to customize your image, then clone the VM disk image as your final Packer image.

## Environment configuration
These parameters allow to define information about platform and temporary VM used to create the image.

### Required
  - `nutanix_username` (string) - User used for Prism Central login.
  - `nutanix_password` (string) - Password of this user for Prism Central login.

  }
```

## VM Clean

Use `vm_clean{}` entry to configure VM cleaning options. This section allows you to clean up the temporary VM after the image creation process is completed.
It can be useful to remove unnecessary components or reset the VM to a clean state before creating a template or exporting an OVA.

All parameters of this `vm_clean` section are described below.

- `cdrom` (bool) - Remove all CD-ROMs from the VM (default is false).

Sample:
```hcl

Template feature need Prism Central 2024.3+ or later.

All parameters of this `template` section are described below.

- `create` (bool) - Create a template from the temporary VM (default is false).
- `name` (string) - Name of the template to create (default is the vm_name).
- `description` (string) - Description of the template to create (default is no description).

Sample:
```hcl
  template {
      create = true
      name = "myTemplate"
      description = "This is my template"
  }
```

## OVA Config

Sample:
```hcl
  ova {
      create = true
      export = true
      format = "vmdk"
      name = "myExportedOVA"
  }
```

## Network Configuration
Use `vm_nics{}` entry to configure NICs in your image

In this section, you have to define network you will to connect with one of this keyword :

- `subnet_name` (string) - Name of the cluster subnet to use.
- `subnet_uuid` (string) - UUID of the cluster subnet to use.

Sample
```hcl
  vm_nics {

  }
```

### Categories Configuration

Use `image_categories{}` and `vm_categories{}` to assign category to your image or vm.  If you want to assign multiple categories , use the entry multiple times.

In this section, you have to define category you will to assign with the following parameters:

- `key` (string) - Name of the category to assign.
- `value` (string) - Value of the category to assign.

Sample
```hcl
  image_categories {
    key = "OSType"
    value = "ubuntu-22.04"
  }
```

Note: Categories must already be present in Prism Central.

## GPU Configuration

Use `GPU` to assign a GPU that is present on `cluster-name` on the temporary vm. Add the name of the GPU you wish to attach.

  gpu {
    name = "Ampere 40"
  }
```
