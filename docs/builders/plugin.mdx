# Nutanix Builder

This document is going to detail all Nutanix plugin source parameters.

## Principle
The Nutanix plugin will create a temporary VM as foundation of your Packer image, apply all providers your want to customize your image, then clone the VM disk image as your final Packer image.

## Environment configuration
These parameters allow to define information about platform and temporary VM used to create the image.

### Required
  - `nutanix_username` (string) - User used for Prism Central login 
  - `nutanix_password` (string) - Password of this user for Prism Central login 
  - `nutanix_endpoint` (string) - Prism Central FQDN or IP
  - `cluster_name` or  `cluster_uuid` (string) - Nutanix cluster name or uuid used to create and store image
  - `os_type` (string) - OS Type ("Linux" or "Windows")
  
### Optional
  - `nutanix_port` (integer) - Port configured on Prism Central to connect on
  - `nutanix_insecure` (boolean) - Authorize connection on Prism Central without valid certificate
  - `cpu` (integer) - Number of vCPU for temporary VM
  - `memory_mb` (integer) - Size of vRAM for temporary VM (in megabytes)
  - `cd_files` (array of strings) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure hierarchy
  - `cd_label` (string) - Label of this CD Drive
  - `boot_type` (string) - Type of boot used on the temporary VM ("legacy" or "UEFI")

## Output configuration
These parameters allow to configure everything around image creation, from the temporary VM connection to the final image definition.

### All OS
- `image_name` (string) - Name of the output image
- `shutdown_command` (string) - Command line to shutdown your temporary VM
- `shutdown_timeout` (string) - Timeout for VM shutdown (format : 2m)
- `communicator` (string) - Protocol used for Packer connection (ex "winrm" or "ssh"). Default is : "ssh"

### Dedicated to Linux
- `user_data` (string) - cloud-init (Linux) content base64 coded.  
- `ssh_username` (string) - user for ssh connection initiated by Packer.
- `ssh_password` (string) - password for the this ssh user.

### Dedicated to Windows
- `winrm_port` (integer) - Port for WinRM communication (Default is 5986)
- `winrm_insecure` (boolean) - Allow insecure connection on WinRM
- `winrm_use_ssl` (boolean) - Request SSL connection with WinRM
- `winrm_timeout` (string) - Timeout for WinRM (format 45m)
- `winrm_username` (string) - User login for WinRM connection 
- `winrm_password` (string) - Password this User

## Disk configuration
Use `vm_disks{}` entry to configure disk to your VM image. If you want to configure several disks, use this entry multiple times.

All parameters of this `vm_disks` section are described below.

3 types of disk configurations can by used 
- disk (create an empty disk)
- disk image (create disk from image)
- ISO image (create disk from image).

### Disk 
- `image_type` (string) - "DISK"
- `disk_size_gb` (integer) - size of th disk (in gigabytes)

Sample:
```hcl
  vm_disks {
      image_type = "DISK"
      disk_size_gb = 30
  }
```

### Disk image
- `image_type` (string) - "DISK_IMAGE"
- `source_image_name` (string) - Name of the image used as disk source (If you want an empty disk, do not specify source)
- `source_image_uuid` (string) - UUID of the image used as disk source (If you want an empty disk, do not specify source)
- `disk_size_gb` (integer) - size of th disk (in gigabytes)

Sample:
```hcl
  vm_disks {
      image_type = "DISK_IMAGE"
      source_image_name = "<myDiskImage>"
      disk_size_gb = 40
  }
```
### ISO Image
- `image_type` (string) - "ISO_IMAGE"
- `source_image_name` (string) - Name of the ISO image to mount
- `source_image_uuid` (string) - UUID of the ISO image to mount

Sample:
```hcl
  vm_disks {
      image_type = "ISO_IMAGE"
      source_image_name = "<myISOimage>"
  }
```

## Network Configuration
Use `vm_nics{}` entry to configure NICs in your image

In this section, you have to define network you will connect on with this keyword :

- `subnet_name` (string) - Name of the cluster subnet to use
- `subnet_uuid` (string) - UUID of the cluster subnet to use

Sample
```hcl
  vm_nics {
    subnet_name       = "<mySubnet>"
  }
```

## Samples
You can find samples [here](https://github.com/nutanix-cloud-native/packer-plugin-nutanix/example) for these instructions usage.
